		I personally spearheaded ONEsite's first mobile development to build the company's mobile web framework.  This involved extending ONEsite's CMS architecture to allow all existing and future functionality to be displayed in a mobile-friendly HTML5 format.  These mobile views were not simply responsive layouts. The mobile framework provided an optimized mobile interface for many of ONEsite's core products including Forums, Messages, ActivityFeed, Photos and Search.  Additionally, the mobile CMS provided the ability to modify the layout, modules, content and design of core and custom mobile pages.
