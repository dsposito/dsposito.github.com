		I personally spearheaded ONEsite Inc's first mobile development to build the company's mobile web framework.  This involved extending ONEsite's CMS architecture to allow all existing and future functionality to be displayed in a mobile-friendly HTML5 format.  These mobile views were not simply responsive layouts. The framework provided an optimized mobile interface for many of ONEsite's core products including Forums, Messages, ActivityFeed, Photos and Search.  Additionally, the CMS provided the ability to modify the layout, modules, content and design of core and custom mobile pages.

		As a member of the SocialCore and Client Services team at ONEsite, I built desktop and mobile enterprise-class social media solutions for American Idol, the NBA, eBay, Betfair, Univision, Meredith Corp, Wizards of the Coast, and a variety of other media and entertainment clients and lifestyle brands.  The SocialCore platform includes a vast array of products including Blogs, Messages, ActivityFeed, Message Boards, Surveys, Polls and much more.  SocialCore utilizes a multitenant software architecture which provides a single instance of the software to all clients while allowing extreme visual and functional customization.
		<br /><br />
		In helping to grow and evolve SocialCore, I developed core competencies in MVC and API systems architecture, single-sign-on (SSO), data migration, legacy software support and project management.
