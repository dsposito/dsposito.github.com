		With my employer suffering from a fragmented array of out-dated billing, support, and communication tools - I lead the development and vision for Volcano CRM. This system provides modern, RESTful APIs for managing sellers, products, customers, orders, and payment gateways. The APIs are fully-documented and have also been leveraged to provide an admin control panel interface. The product has evolved to also encompass CRM-like tools for a business's support and sales teams. Volcano CRM not only achieved the goal of solving many internal information and communication problems it also resulted in a brand new product category for my employer as a stand-alone product.

		The Static platform has helped democratize many aspects of cloud computing. Static's Cloud Manager provides a robust and easy to use PaaS and IaaS control panel with email, domain, billing and additional hosting tools. Essentially, Cloud Manager provides a central source for creating and managing applications (WordPress, Drupal, custom, etc), Services (MySQL, Hadoop, Redis, etc), Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and your entire web application workflow. Cloud Manager is available as both a hosted and enterprise local install solution. Cloud Manager's key differentiator is its technology agnostic approach. This approach, leveraging the adapter pattern architecture, allows the software to easily interface with a variety of PaaS, IaaS, and billing technologies across a horizontal market.

The app is available on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fireworks-pop-free/id536038601" target="_blank">App Store</a> and allows you to create spectacular firework performances by selecting a firework backdrop, style and color (or creating your own!) and tapping on the screen. Firework sequences can be created and exported to share with others.

		I personally spearheaded SocialCore's first mobile development efforts and built the company's mobile web framework. This involved extending SocialCore's CMS architecture to allow all existing and future functionality to be displayed in a mobile-friendly HTML5 format. These mobile views were not simply responsive layouts. The framework provided an optimized mobile interface for many of SocialCore's core products including Forums, Messages, ActivityFeed, Photos and Search. Additionally, the CMS provided the ability to modify the layout, modules, content and design of core and custom mobile pages.
